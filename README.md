## Motivation

I want employers and other developers to know that I am able to create a mobile responsive portfolio. 

## Description

* Use Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio.
* Create the following files: index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html.
* Using Bootstrap, develop your portfolio site with the following items:

    1. A navbar
    2. A responsive layout
    3. Responsive images

* The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.

## Requirements 

* Functional, deployed application.
* Navbar must be consistent on each page.
* Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.
* All links must work.
* Must use semantic html.
* Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)
* Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)
* Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.
